<title>Best Avengers Poster</title>

<h1>Which Avengers poster is the best?</h1>

<p>So we've got four Avengers movies and four Avengers posters. The original, <i>Age of Ultron</i>, <i>Infinity War</i>, and <i>Endgame</i>. Each one looks unique but some look better than the others. Let's take a look and see which poster looks the most appealing.</p>

<h2><i>The Avengers</i></h2>

<p>The poster for the first Avengers film looks... 'aight'; excuse my slang. While it does showcase its epicness, with various explosions, characters giving badass poses, and action on every corner, the poster as a whole appears awkward and disjointed. It's cool but I'm not a fan of the prominent blue color scheme. Personally when I think of Avengers, I think of red and there's very little red (or orange) in the poster. Engaging but a bit unappealing.</p>


<h2><i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i></h2>

<p>The Age of Ultron poster manages to be different and worse than the first film. First off, the color scheme is bleh! I'm not a fan of the grey color scheme. Although it relates to the villain, Ultron, it gives the poster a very boring look. The character placement also looks awkward. The heroes seem to form a U-shape at the bottom of the poster, while Ultron (and Vision) fill the space above. One issue carried over from the first poster is the character sizes. Some characters are unusually smaller than others. Different but bland.</p>

<h2><i>Avengers: Infinity War</i></h2>

<p>Absolutely awesome! Marvel did an amazing job with the Infinity War poster, much like their previous posters in the MCU's third phase. Unlike the issues with color scheme and character placement the previous two posters held, Infinity War perfectly balances, no pun intended, the placement for each character. Thanos is the star, Tony in the middle, Cap & Thor directly below, the Wakandans and Guardians on the sides and Scarlett, Vision, Wong, and Strange at the top. Of course we can't forget good ole Spider-Man at the bottom center. The poster is also bursting with color! Gold, yellow, orange, red, and blue. Blended well nice together. The best.</p>

<h2><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></h2>

<p>Purple! Endgame went with a more simple design, though the symmetry is still present. Obviously the simpler design is due to half of the characters having died. While not as epic as Infinity War, Endgame's poster feels a bit more personal and emotional.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, I would say that <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> is the best Avengers poster. With it's well-balanced structure of characters, as well as its bold use of color, the Infinity War poster screams action, epicness, and all-in-all superhero. You <em>want to</em> look at everything on the poster.</p>
